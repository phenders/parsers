## Datasource Notes

You might want to include notes about the datasource so that someone other than you can maintain this parser and understand the types of changes this dataset may be prone to, information about odd formatting, etc.

If you have documentation that came with the datasource, including PDFs or txt files describing the format, please include that content in the `docs/` directory.
